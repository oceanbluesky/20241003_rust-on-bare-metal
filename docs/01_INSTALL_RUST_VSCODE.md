# Install Rust and Visual Studio Code

The following instructions are for setting up a student machine for the course. There are instructions for [Linux](#linux), [macOS](#macos), [Windows](#windows), and [Windows WSL 2](#windows-wsl-2). Also, [all students](#all-students) will need to create a GitHub account.

These instructions provide a minimal setup for the course. During the course other software and code libraries will be installed. Students will need local admin and network access on their machines.

These instructions will ensure you have Rust installed, Visual Studio Code installed, a Rust debugging environment, and the ability to install crates with Cargo.

Complete the setup appropriate for your machine. We will be using a tool named Valgrind in the class. Valgrind does not work on Windows. If you are using Windows, you will need to use Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL 2) to run Valgrind.

- Jump to: [Windows](#windows)
- Jump to: [Windows WSL 2](#windows-wsl-2)

During the course additional Rust tools and crates will be installed. Also, depending on your operating system additional software may be required. Students will need local admin and network access on their machines.

Also, for courses which include bare metal programming, each student will need a Microbit V2. The Microbit V2 is a small microcontroller board that can be programmed in Rust. The Microbit V2 can be purchased from various online retailers.

Before purchasing, verify if your employer or the trainer will be providing the device for you. The link above is NOT an Amazon affiliate link.

## All Students

1. To access the courseware for the class, all students will need to create a GitHub account. If you do not already have a GitHub account, please create one at [https://www.github.com](https://www.github.com). Please know your GitHub username and password on the first day of class.

    **Note:** GitHub Enterprise accounts will not work. You must have a personal, public GitHub account.
